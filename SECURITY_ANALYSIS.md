# Security Analysis Report
## Secure File Sharing & Messaging Application

### Executive Summary

This document provides a comprehensive security analysis of the implemented PKI-based secure file sharing and messaging application. The system employs industry-standard cryptographic protocols and implements multiple layers of security to ensure confidentiality, integrity, and authentication of user data.

## 1. Cryptographic Architecture

### 1.1 Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) Implementation

**Certificate Authority (CA) Design:**
- Self-signed root CA with RSA-2048 key pair
- X.509 v3 certificates with proper extensions
- Certificate validity period: 1 year
- Automatic CA initialization on server startup

**Security Strength:**
- RSA-2048 provides approximately 112 bits of security
- Sufficient protection against current computational attacks
- Resistant to quantum attacks until large-scale quantum computers

**Threat Mitigation:**
- Certificate spoofing prevented by CA validation
- Trust chain verification ensures authenticity
- Certificate revocation framework implemented

### 1.2 Hybrid Encryption Scheme

**File Encryption Process:**
1. Generate random AES-256 key for each file
2. Encrypt file content with AES-256-CBC
3. Encrypt AES key with RSA-2048 using recipient's public key
4. Store encrypted content and encrypted key separately

**Security Benefits:**
- AES-256 provides excellent performance for large files
- RSA ensures secure key distribution
- Perfect Forward Secrecy through unique AES keys
- Resistance to cryptanalytic attacks

**Message Encryption:**
- Same hybrid approach for consistent security model
- End-to-end encryption between users
- Non-repudiation through digital signatures

### 1.3 Digital Signature Implementation

- Message authenticity guaranteed
- Hash-based integrity checking (SHA-256)
- Tamper detection capabilities

## 2. Authentication & Authorization

### 2.1 Challenge-Response Authentication

**Process Flow:**
1. Server generates random challenge
2. Client signs challenge with private key
3. Server verifies signature with user's public key
4. JWT token issued upon successful verification

**Security Advantages:**
- Prevents password-based attacks
- Proof of private key possession
- No sensitive data transmitted
- Replay attack resistant

### 2.2 Session Management

- Rate limiting on authentication attempts

## 3. Key Management Security

### 3.1 Client-Side Key Storage

**Storage Strategy:**

- Automatic key expiration (24 hours)

**Security Rationale:**
- Prevents key extraction from persistent storage
- Reduces attack surface for malicious scripts
- Forces user authentication for each session
- Maintains user control over private keys

**Export/Import Mechanism:**
- Password-encrypted key backup
- User-initiated export only
- Secure key recovery process
- No server-side private key storage

### 3.2 Server-Side Certificate Management

**CA Key Protection:**
